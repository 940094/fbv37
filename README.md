# Motivation
The motivation behind this project came from the DRY (or, do not repeat yourself) principle.

My background as a Marketer in the Real Estate industry required that I perform repetitive tasks for clients so I decided to create a program to do it for me -- and eventually sell the program to my clients. Ultimately, making myself obsolete but in the process creating a useful tool.

# Overview
At a 40,000 ft. view, this code helps Real Estate Agents create Facebook Lead Ads so they can generate leads for the lowest cost.

# Use
Once installed this code base can be used to create, update, and delete Facebook Lead Ad Campaigns.

Here's a demo video on exactly how to do that:

I hope you enjoy using this program as much as I enjoyed making it!!
